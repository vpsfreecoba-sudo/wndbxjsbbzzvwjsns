      "Added VFR, co64, and codec-aware support to frame density inflation",
      "Added rotation preservation, timescale-aware ELST, and container normalization",

    "version": "2.1.0",
    "date": "2026-06-17",
    "changes": [
      "When interpolation is enabled, the VFI engine runs first to produce a 60fps video, then the output is fed into the full 7-pass non-interpolation pipeline (CBR re-encode + binary patches). This ensures VFI output gets the same TikTok bypass treatment as the standard path.",
      "After VFI completes, the FFmpeg instance is destroyed and recreated for the re-encode pipeline to prevent stale WASM state errors.",
      "VFI now uses the output resolution selector (1080p / 2K) directly, eliminating the need for metadata extraction.",
      "Interpolation path now uses `getDimensionsFromMp4Container()` to read width/height from the MP4 container instead of `getVideoDurationAndResolution()`, reducing overhead.",
      "The 30-second video duration limit has been removed. Videos of any length are now processed.",
      "Removed codec detection logic. VFI now hardcodes libx264 encoder, matching the 7-pass pipeline.",
      "Removed unused functions `CODEC_ENCODER_MAP`, `probeSourceFps()`, `probeInputCodec()`, and `execWithEncoder()`.",
      "Fixed intermittent errors when running re-encode after VFI by resetting the FFmpeg instance between stages.",
      "All modals (TikTok, VFI) now properly lock background scroll on mobile and desktop.",
      "Fixed \"Open TikTok Studio\" button text centering on mobile.",
      "Added `overscroll-behavior: contain` to prevent scroll-through in the changelog panel.",
      "Global scrollbar styled to 2px width with theme-colored thumb.",
      "Moved to bottom-right corner with slide-in animation from right to left."

    "version": "2.0.0",
    "date": "2026-06-16",
    "changes": [
      "Non-Interpolation path inflates the MP4 sample table — a clip is rewritten to declare more virtual frames (real samples kept + dummy 8-byte samples whose chunk offsets point to a safe padding region at EOF). TikTok detects this as high-density content and skips heavy recompression, preserving original visual quality.",
      "The inflation multiplier is configurable. 5x is the confirmed sweetspot — it passes TikTok compression while keeping the dummy-frame tail (and the brief end-of-video freeze) short. 10x also works but produces a longer freeze.",
      "Output can be scaled to 1080p or 2K (1440p) via a UI dropdown. Bitrate auto-scales with resolution — 1080p uses 14261k, 2K uses 25000k. Both confirmed to bypass TikTok compression.",
      "Extracted all MP4 binary patching functions from `app.js` into four dedicated ES modules under `src/`.",
      "Expanded from 3 passes to 7 passes.",
      "The 60fps VFI path now shares the same metadata treatment — timescale 90000, AAC 250k audio, udta strip, tkhd matrix reset, and comment udta injection.",
      "Switched Non-Interpolation encoder from libx265 CRF 18 to libx264 CBR, Main profile Level 4.2, matching the reference output profile that bypasses TikTok compression.",
      "Added `getDimensionsFromMp4Container` to read video width/height/rotation directly from the `tkhd` box binary.",
      "History thumbnails are now captured from the processed output buffer instead of the original input file.",
      "The screen stays awake during processing on supported mobile browsers.",
      "Added a direct link to TikTok Studio web upload, with a mobile-only modal guiding users to enable desktop mode first.",
      "Replaced libx265 CRF encoding with libx264 CBR pipeline.",
      "Removed `-noautorotate` FFmpeg flag. FFmpeg now bakes rotation metadata into pixel data during encode.",
      "Updated header subtitle and system stats to reflect the re-encode + frame density engine.",
      "Fixed critical bug where audio chunk offsets were not shifted after moov expansion during sample table inflation.",
      "Container-level dimension parsing now correctly identifies orientation for HEVC inputs."

      "Strips all source metadata including GPS location, device identifiers.",

      "The 60fps VFI interpolation path retains the original ZeroLoss + Quantum Matrix pipeline."

      "Upgraded from linear blending to bilateral motion-compensated interpolation.",

      "Instant termination of active WebAssembly worker threads on cancellation.",
